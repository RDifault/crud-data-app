# Simple CRUD Data App

This is my submission for a company Frontend coding pretest. 

API Used:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

Tech Stack:
  - React.Js
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Redux Toolkit
  - Axios
  - ANT Design
  - React-Router
  - Chart.Js
  - React-ChartJs-2
  - Vite

Disclaimer: The API used is a simulation/fake API. Which means, any CRUD operations done will be reset if the web is refreshed.
Use the built-in navigation to navigate the web without refreshing it to see the whole CRUD operations
